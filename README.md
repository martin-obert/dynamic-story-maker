# Project Description

## Stories
- just text with flavored assets within

## Time tracker
- not like hours, but rather 1/4 day < Days < Weeks < Months < Years

## Assets
- divided by Types: NPC, Buildings, Zones, Encounter (link to Beyond)
- consider defaults for each type as flag or tag

### NPC
- UUID as default reference
- system name (replaces generated UUID) for better readability
- display name
- link to Beyond or some stats for quick reference

### Dialogues
- bound tot NPCs mainly, no obligatory chats like "Hello", "Good day" etc., these should be related to the main story

### Tags
- attachable to assets and stories, tags have values (string|number|guid)
- consider pre-defined tags (default)

## Background events
- this should keep players in the story
- depends on the "time tracker" feature
-
